Artificial Intelligence has come a long way and is now entering the world of programming. This article talks about the recent code-generating technologies such as Github's new [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Enzyme](https://enzyme.so/), [Debuild](https://debuild.co/) etc, and how their recent success may potentially put programmers at risk. However, the author of this article is of the view that this is not happening anytime soon. The main reason outlined inclde, the complexity of being a programmer, large and constantly changing tech stacks, debugging erroneous code, communicating with stakeholders which may involve explaining wht youre doing in non-technical terms. Therefore, being a programmer is not just about the code but it consistes of a diverse skillset, so these code generating AIs that are coming to be these days would play a hand in empowering developers than replacing them.

Out of the scope of this article, software engineers and other programmers remain confident that their jobs are safe from any AI. According to them, for AI to replace programmers, clients will have to accurately describe what they want...

Thank you for sharing this article and your opinion about the topic. However, I believe that AI will definitely have an affect on programmers. We have seen this in many other cases that as technology improves, underqualified workforce decreases. Similarly, AI will replace some of the programmers and will the force the market to have highly qualified programmers.

Thanks for the good read: it is a somewhat popular debate in the recent decades of whether technology and machines will take our jobs as our technological advancement speed are increasingly increasing. As the author says, it is not anytime soon, as in, anytime within 5 to 10 years. But considering the difference in sophistication of algorithms of bleeding edge technology companies currently compared to just 20 years ago, I think it is a well-placed belief that the point where AI reaches the level of human programmers is within our lifetime.
