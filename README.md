Artificial Intelligence has come a long way and is now entering the world of programming. This article talks about the recent code-generating technologies such as Github's new [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Enzyme](https://enzyme.so/), [Debuild](https://debuild.co/) etc, and how their recent success may potentially put programmers at risk. However, the author of this article is of the view that this is not happening anytime soon. The main reason outlined inclde, the complexity of being a programmer, large and constantly changing tech stacks, debugging erroneous code, communicating with stakeholders which may involve explaining wht youre doing in non-technical terms. Therefore, being a programmer is not just about the code but it consistes of a diverse skillset, so these code generating AIs that are coming to be these days would play a hand in empowering developers than replacing them.

Out of the scope of this article, software engineers and other programmers remain confident that their jobs are safe from any AI. According to them, for AI to replace programmers, clients will have to accurately describe what they want...
